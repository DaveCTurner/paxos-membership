% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amssymb}

\usepackage{amsthm}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{lemma}[theorem]{Lemma}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{P}{axos} is an algorithm for achieving consensus on (or
\textit{choosing}) a sequence $v_0, v_1, \ldots$ of values in a distributed,
fault-tolerant fashion. It typically runs on a cluster of $2f+1$ nodes, where
$f$ is the number of faulty nodes that should be tolerated, and consensus is
achieved on a value $v_i \in \mathbb V$ when $\ge f+1$ (i.e.  a majority) of
the nodes agree. More generally, if $\mathbb A$ is the set of all nodes then
there is a set $Q \subseteq \mathcal P \mathbb A$ of \textit{quorums}, and a
value is chosen when all nodes $a \in q$ agree for some quorum $q \in Q$.

It is normally necessary to be able to add or remove nodes from the cluster,
which amounts to the ability to change the set $Q$ of quorums while the cluster
is running. Since it is crucial that all participating nodes agree on what
constitutes a majority at all times, the membership of the cluster is normally
represented as a state machine whose transitions occur when particular values
in the sequence are chosen.

Each value $v_i \in \mathbb V$ is chosen using a separate instance $i$ of a
two-phase consensus protocol known as \textit{Synod}. The full Paxos algorithm
optimises this approach by using the observation that there is a $N$ such that
all Synod instances $i > N$ are in the same state at any one time and this set
of instances can therefore be manipulated as a single entity. It starts by
running phase I of all instances at once and then runs phase II of each
instance in turn to yield the desired sequence of chosen values. It normally
remains in phase II for an extended period, but will return to phase I if
certain nodes become faulty, or if messages between certain pairs of nodes
cease to be delivered reliably for a period, or if the set of quorums $Q$
changes.

The algorithm allows for \textit{pipelining} in phase II: later instances can
be started before earlier ones have been chosen, which means that the rate of
choosing values is not limited by network latency. The pipeline runs smoothly
as long as phase I does not need to run again, but may stall if phase I is
re-run. A pipeline stall can be observed as jitter in the rate at which values
are decided.

It is unavoidable that a faulty node or disrupted communications may have an
impact on its performance, but changing the set of quorums $Q$ of the cluster
is a common task and it is undesirable that it should have any such effect.
The usual approach to avoiding jitter caused by a pipeline stall when a cluster
membership change is agreed at instance $i$ is to postpone the effects of the
change until instance $i + \alpha$ for some $\alpha \ge 0$. If $\alpha$ is
large enough, there is time to run the new phase I before the pipeline stalls.
On the other hand, if $\alpha$ is too large then the membership change can take
an unreasonably long time to take effect.

As described below, it is in fact possible to delay the effect of a membership
change for as long as required to run phase I again, but then to allow it to
take effect once the phase I has completed, without needing to carefully choose
a value for the delay parameter $\alpha$.

\subsection{The Synod algorithm}

Synod is an algorithm for achieving consensus on a single value in a
distributed system comprising a set of nodes which can communicate by sending
messages to each other. Messages may be delayed, reordered, duplicated and
dropped.

Let $\mathbb P$ be a set of \textit{proposal identifiers} with a wellfounded
total order $\prec$. Let $\mathbb A$ be a set of \textit{node identifiers} and
let $\mathbb V$ be the set of values to be chosen.

\def\prep#1{\mathbf{prepare}(#1)}
\def\prom#1#2{\mathbf{promised}(#1,#2)}
\def\fprom#1#2{\mathbf{promised}(#1,#2)}
\def\bprom#1#2#3{\mathbf{promised}(#1,#2;#3)}
\def\prop#1{\mathbf{proposed}(#1)}
\def\acc#1#2{\mathbf{accepted}(#1,#2)}
\def\chosen#1{\mathbf{chosen}(#1)}
\def\owner#1{\mathrm{owner}(#1)}

The Synod algorithm involves four kinds of message, described below.
Throughout, $p, p' \in \mathbb P$ and $a \in \mathbb A$.  Phase I starts with
the broadcast of a \textit{prepare} message $\prep{p}$ to which each node $a$
may respond with a \textit{promise} message, either a \textit{free promise}
written $\fprom{a}{p}$ or a \textit{forced promise} written $\bprom{a}{p}{p'}$.
Phase II starts with the broadcast of a \textit{proposal} message $\prop{p}$ to
which each node $a$ may respond with an \textit{acceptance} message
$\acc{a}{p}$. It is convenient to add another kind of message $\chosen{p}$
which can be thought of as being sent by any node when a proposal has been
chosen. There is also a function $v : \mathbb P \to \mathbb V$ assigning a
value to each proposal, and a function $\mathrm{owner} : \mathbb P \to \mathbb
A$ assigning an owner to each proposal.

It is also convenient to treat these as predicates indicating that the
corresponding messages have been sent. For instance, the predicate $\acc{a}{p}$
indicates that the message $\acc{a}{p}$ has been sent and $\neg \prop{p}$
indicates that the message $\prop{p}$ has not been sent. Because messages may
be delayed or dropped, a node can only know a message has not been sent if it
can prove, based solely on the messages it alone has sent and received, that no
other node has sent it.

Theorem \ref{synod-safety-theorem} shows the safety property of the Synod algorithm:
whenever $\chosen{p_1}$ and $\chosen{p_2}$ then $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$. The full
details of the conditions under which nodes can send these messages is included
in appendix \ref{synod-safety}.

A node considers phase I to be complete when promise messages (either free or
forced) have been received from a quorum of nodes, and similarly considers
phase II to be complete when acceptances have been received from a quorum.  The
choice of quorums can depend on the proposal number $p$, but for any $p$ it
must be the case that there is at least one node that is in both quorums. More
formally, if $p \in \mathbb P$ then write $Q^\textrm{I}(p)$ and
$Q^\textrm{II}(p) \subseteq \mathcal P \mathbb A$ for the sets of phase I and
phase II quorums for proposal $p$ respectively. The crucial property is that
for each $q_1 \in Q^\textrm{I}(p)$ and $q_2 \in Q^\textrm{II}(p)$ it must be
the case that $q_1 \cap q_2 \ne \varnothing$.

It is usual to have $Q^\textrm{I}(p) = Q^\textrm{II}(p)$ and the original
presentation of the Synod algorithm did not allow for them to be unequal. The
proof of theorem \ref{synod-safety-theorem} in appendix \ref{synod-safety} is a
minor generalisation of the original one to demonstrate that safety is
preserved even when $Q^\textrm{I}(p) \ne Q^\textrm{II}(p)$.

\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)

\section{Invariants preserved by the Synod algorithm}
\label{synod-safety}

The safety property of the Synod algorithm is derived from the following
invariants.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \label{synod-quorums} There are sets of quorums $Q^\textrm{I},
Q^\textrm{II} \subseteq \mathcal P \mathbb A$ such that $q_1 \cap q_2 \ne
\varnothing$ for all $q_1 \in Q^\textrm{I}$ and $q_2 \in Q^\textrm{II}$.

\item \label{synod-fprom} A node $a$ may send a $\fprom{a}{p}$ message only if
$\neg\acc{a}{p'}$ for all $p' \prec p$.

\item \label{synod-bprom} A node $a$ may send a $\bprom{a}{p}{p'}$ message only
if
\begin{itemize}
\item $p' \prec p$,
\item $\acc{a}{p'}$, and
\item $p'$ is the greatest such proposal, in the sense that $\neg\acc{a}{p''}$
for all $p''$ such that $p' \prec p'' \prec p$.
\end{itemize}

\item \label{synod-prop} A node $a$ may send a $\prop{p}$ message whenever
$\owner{p} = a$ and there is a quorum $q \in Q^\textrm{I}(p)$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item for every $a' \in q$ either $\fprom{a'}{p}$ or $\exists p'.
\bprom{a'}{p}{p'}$, and
\item if $P = \{ p'. \exists a' \in q. \bprom{a'}{p}{p'} \} \ne \varnothing$
then $v(p) = v(\mathrm{max}(P))$.
\end{itemize}

\item \label{synod-acc} A node $a$ may send an $\acc{a}{p}$ message as long as

\begin{itemize}
\item $\prop{p}$,
\item $\neg\fprom{a}{p'}$ for all $p' \succ p$, and
\item $\neg\bprom{a}{p'}{p''}$ for all $p' \succ p$ and any $p''$.
\end{itemize}

\item \label{synod-chosen} A node may send a $\chosen{p}$ message whenever
there is a quorum $q \in Q^\textrm{II}(p)$ such that for every $a \in q$ it has
received an $\acc{a}{p}$ message.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma}\label{synod-acc-fprom}If $\acc{a}{p_2}$ and $p_2 \prec p_1$ then
it cannot be the case that $\fprom{a}{p_1}$.\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}At the point in time that node $a$ sent $\acc{a}{p_2}$, by
invariant \ref{synod-acc} it had not previously sent $\fprom{a}{p_1}$. However
by invariant \ref{synod-fprom} having sent $\acc{a}{p_2}$ it may not
subsequently send $\fprom{a}{p_1}$ either, as required.\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{synod-acc-bprom}If $\acc{a}{p_2}$, $\bprom{a}{p_1}{p_3}$
and $p_2 \prec p_1$ then $p_2 \preceq p_3$.\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}At the point in time that node $a$ sent $\acc{a}{p_2}$, because
$p_2 \prec p_1$ and by invariant \ref{synod-acc} it must have not already sent
$\bprom{a}{p_1}{p_3}$, so it must have sent this message later. By invariant
\ref{synod-bprom} it must also be the case that $\acc{a}{p_3}$, and $p_3$ is
the highest-numbered proposal $a$ has accepted when it sent this message, so
$p_2 \preceq p_3$ as required. \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{synod-lemma} If $\chosen{p_2}$, $\prop{p_1}$ and $p_2 \prec
p_1$ then $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$. \end{lemma}

\begin{proof}Suppose for a contradiction the result is false, and since $\prec$
is wellfounded suppose without loss of generality that $p_1$ is the
smallest-numbered proposal at which it is false.

Since $\chosen{p_2}$, by invariant \ref{synod-chosen} there is a quorum $q_2
\in Q^\textrm{II}(p_2)$ such that $\acc{a}{p_2}$ for every $a \in q_2$. By
lemma \ref{synod-acc-fprom} it cannot be that $\fprom{a}{p_1}$ for any $a \in
q_2$.

Also, since $\prop{p_1}$, by invariant \ref{synod-prop} there is a quorum $q_1
\in Q^\textrm{I}(p_1)$ such that either $\fprom{a}{p_1}$ or $\exists p'.
\bprom{a}{p_1}{p'}$ for all $a \in q_1$.

Let $P = \{ p'. \exists a \in q_1.  \bprom{a}{p_1}{p'} \}$ be the set of
proposals referenced by forced promises. By invariant \ref{synod-quorums}, $q_1
\cap q_2 \ne \varnothing$ so it follows that $P \ne \varnothing$, which means
that $v(p_1) = v(\mathrm{max}(P))$ by invariant \ref{synod-prop}. Let
$a_{\mathrm{max}} \in q_1$ be such that
$\bprom{a_{\mathrm{max}}}{p_1}{\mathrm{max}(P)}$. By invariant
\ref{synod-bprom} it follows that $\mathrm{max}(P) \prec p_1$ and also that
$\acc{a_{\mathrm{max}}}{\mathrm{max}(P)}$ and hence $\prop{\mathrm{max}(P)}$ by
invariant \ref{synod-acc}. Furthermore by lemma \ref{synod-acc-bprom} it
follows that $p_2 \preceq \mathrm{max}(P)$ and since $p_1$ was assumed to be
the smallest counterexample it must be that $v(\mathrm{max}(P)) = v(p_2)$.
Hence $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$ which is a contradiction as required.  \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{synod-safety-theorem} If $\chosen{p_1}$ and
$\chosen{p_2}$ then $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$.  \end{theorem}

\begin{proof} If $p_1 = p_2$ then the result is clear, so assume that $p_1 \ne
p_2$ and therefore without loss of generality that $p_2 \prec p_1$. By
invariant \ref{synod-chosen} there is a quorum $q \in Q^\textrm{II}(p_1)$ such
that $\acc{a}{p_1}$ for every node $a \in q$. Since $q$ is nonempty, by
invariant \ref{synod-acc} it must be that $\prop{p_1}$ was previously sent.
Therefore by lemma \ref{synod-lemma} it follows that $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$ as
required.  \end{proof}
