% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of

% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{P}{axos} is an algorithm for achieving consensus on (or
\textit{choosing}) a sequence $v_0, v_1, \ldots$ of values in a distributed,
fault-tolerant fashion~\cite{part-time-parliament}. It guarantees system-wide
\textit{consistency}, in the sense that the values chosen are guaranteed to be
equal across the whole system even in the presence of failures. It typically
runs on a cluster of $2f+1$ nodes, where $f$ is the number of faulty nodes that
should be tolerated, and consensus is achieved on a value $v_i \in \mathbb V$
when $\ge f+1$ (i.e.  a majority) of the nodes agree.  More generally, if
$\mathbb A$ is the set of all nodes then there is a set $Q \subseteq \mathcal P
\mathbb A$ of \textit{quorums}, and a value is chosen when all nodes $a \in q$
agree for some quorum $q \in Q$. The set of quorums is called the
\textit{membership} of the cluster.

It is normally necessary to be able to add or remove nodes from the cluster,
which amounts to the ability to change the membership while the cluster is
running. It is crucial that all participating nodes agree on the cluster
membership at all times, and Dynamic Paxos~\cite{cheap-paxos} achieves this by
tracking the cluster membership with a state machine whose transitions occur
when particular values in the sequence are chosen.

Each value $v_i \in \mathbb V$ is chosen using a separate instance $i$ of a
two-phase consensus protocol known as \textit{Synod}. The full Paxos algorithm
essentially runs an infinite sequence of Synod protocols in parallel: it starts
by running phase I of all instances at once and then runs phase II of each
instance in turn to yield the desired sequence of chosen values. It normally
remains in phase II for extended periods of time, but will return to phase I if
certain nodes become faulty, or if messages between certain pairs of nodes
cease to be delivered reliably for a period, or if the membership changes.

Paxos allows for \textit{pipelining} in phase II: later instances can be
started before earlier ones have been chosen, which means that the rate of
choosing values is not limited by network latency. The pipeline runs smoothly
as long as phase I does not need to run again, but may stall if phase I is
re-run. A pipeline stall can be observed as jitter in the rate at which values
are chosen.

It is unavoidable that a faulty node or disrupted communications may have an
impact on the system's performance, but changing its membership is a routine
task which should have no such effect. Dynamic Paxos avoids a pipeline stall
when a cluster membership change is chosen at instance $i$ by postponing the
effects of the change until instance $i + \alpha$ for some $\alpha > 0$. If
$\alpha$ is large enough, there is time to run the new phase I before the
pipeline stalls.  On the other hand, if $\alpha$ is too large then the
membership change can take an unreasonably long time to take effect.

The value of the delay parameter $\alpha$ may be allowed to vary while the
system is running, so it is certainly possible to design a mechanism for
choosing a reasonably suitable value and adapting it to changing system
conditions. The approach described here allows phase II to start using a new
membership without re-running phase I; this is shown to preserve consistency as
long as the membership change is sufficiently small (in a sense which is made
precise in section \ref{types-of-membership-change} below.) By removing phase I
from the critical path of a membership change the possibility of jitter caused
by a pipeline stall is eliminated.

The technique shown here also supports arbitrary membership changes happening
in a single step just as in Dynamic Paxos, but any changes that are not
sufficiently small continue to carry the risk of jitter. In reality, arbitrary
changes would normally be performed as a sequence of these small, jitter-free
changes as discussed in section \ref{discussion} below.

\section{The Synod Algorithm}

Synod\cite{part-time-parliament} is an algorithm for achieving consensus on a
single value in a distributed system comprising a set of nodes which can
communicate by sending messages to each other. Communication is asynchronous
but not Byzantine, in the sense that each messages may be delayed, reordered,
duplicated and dropped but not corrupted. It is briefly reviewed here for the
sake of consistency of notation and to introduce some generalisations.

Let $\mathbb P$ be a set of \textit{proposal identifiers} with a wellfounded
total order $\prec$. Let $\mathbb A$ be a set of \textit{node identifiers} and
let $\mathbb V$ be the set of values that may be chosen.

\def\prep#1{\mathbf{prepare}(#1)}
\def\mprom#1#2#3{\mathbf{promised}_{\ge #1}(#2,#3)}
\def\fprom#1#2#3{\mathbf{promised}_{#1}(#2,#3)}
\def\bprom#1#2#3#4{\mathbf{promised}_{#1}(#2,#3;#4)}
\def\prop#1#2{\mathbf{proposed}_{#1}(#2)}
\def\acc#1#2#3{\mathbf{accepted}_{#1}(#2,#3)}
\def\chosen#1#2{\mathbf{chosen}_{#1}(#2)}
\def\owner#1{\mathrm{owner}(#1)}

The Synod algorithm involves four kinds of message, described below.
Throughout, $p, p' \in \mathbb P$ and $a \in \mathbb A$.  Phase I starts with
the broadcast of a \textit{prepare} message $\prep{p}$ to which each node $a$
may respond with a \textit{promise} message, either a \textit{free promise}
written $\fprom{}{a}{p}$ or a \textit{forced promise} written
$\bprom{}{a}{p}{p'}$.  Phase II starts with the broadcast of a
\textit{proposal} message $\prop{}{p}$ to which each node $a$ may respond with
an \textit{acceptance} message $\acc{}{a}{p}$.

It is convenient also to use these symbols as predicates indicating whether the
corresponding messages have been sent. For instance, the predicate
$\acc{}{a}{p}$ indicates that the message $\acc{}{a}{p}$ has been sent and
$\neg \prop{}{p}$ indicates that the message $\prop{}{p}$ has not been sent.
Because messages may be delayed, reordered or dropped, a node can only know a
message has not been sent if it can prove, based solely on the messages it
alone has sent and received, that no other node has sent it. This works in
practice because the messages $\fprom{}{a}{p}$, $\bprom{}{a}{p}{p'}$ and
$\acc{}{a}{p}$ may only originate from the node $a$, and there is a function
$\mathrm{owner} : \mathbb P \to \mathbb A$ assigning an owner to each proposal
such that the message $\prop{}{p}$ may only originate from node $\owner{p}$.

It is convenient to add another predicate $\chosen{}{p}$ which indicates that
the proposal $p$ has been chosen and hence phase II is complete. There is also
a function $v : \mathbb P \to \mathbb V$ assigning a value to each proposal, discussed
in more detail in section \ref{value-function} below, and the system satisfies
a set of invariants as described in appendix \ref{synod-safety} from which can
be shown the key consistency property of the Synod algorithm: \[\textrm{if }
\chosen{}{p} \textrm{ and } \chosen{}{p'} \textrm { then } v(p) = v(p').\]

Each node operates as a state machine whose transitions are caused by the
receipts of messages. A node may emit $\prop{}{p}$ when it considers phase I to
be complete at proposal $p$. A node considers phase I to be complete at
proposal $p$ when promise messages for $p$ have been received from a quorum of
nodes, and similarly considers phase II to be complete at $p$ when a quorum of
acceptances of $p$ has been received. The quorums themselves can depend on the
proposal number $p$ and the phase as discussed in section
\ref{per-phase-quorums} below, but for any $p$ it must be the case that there
is at least one node that is in a quorum of each phase.

\subsection{Implementing the value function}\label{value-function}

In the original presentation of the Synod algorithm, the values of proposals
are carried along with their identifiers in the messages $\bprom{}{a}{p}{
p',v(p') }$, $\prop{}{ p,v(p)}$ and $\acc{}{a}{ p,v(p) }$. Observation O4 in
\cite{cheap-paxos} notes that these values can be replaced in some cases by
hashes, which is useful if the values themselves are expensive to transmit
between nodes. This can be taken one step further and the values can be
completely elided from the messages that take part in the Synod protocol,
allowing considerably more freedom in the implementation of the function $v$
without sacrificing consistency.

Although it appears that the function $v$ is fixed, in practice it is allowed
to change as the system runs. Treating it as fixed simplifies the consistency
proof and highlights that its values need not be included in all messages, but
means that the system cannot be shown to satisfy any useful liveness
properties.

To recover liveness, it is enough to note that if the invariants of appendix
\ref{synod-safety} are satisfied with a value function $v$ then they are
satisfied for any value function $v'$ that agrees with $v$ on sent proposals,
i.e. having $v(p) = v'(p)$ whenever $\prop{}{p}$.  Furthermore only $\owner{p}$
may propose $p$, so if it has not yet proposed a value for $p$ it can, in
effect, freely modify $v(p)$ as desired.

It is also important for liveness that the implementation of $v$ is resilient
to the same failure modes as the rest of the system. In these terms the classic
presentation ensures this resilience by including relevant values of $v$ in
messages. Since the value of each proposal $p$ has at most one writer,
$\owner{p}$, there are more efficient ways to implement $v$: for instance, the
Cheap Paxos algorithm implements $v$ using only the $f+1$ primary processors
and none of the auxiliary processors, representing $v$ as an optimised version
of a replicated insert-only set \cite{crdts} of pairs $\{ \langle p, v(p)
\rangle \mid \prop{}{p} \}$.

\subsection{Per-phase quorums}\label{per-phase-quorums}

The heart of the consistency property of the Synod algorithm is that the set of
nodes involved in completing phase I must always intersect the set of nodes
involved in completing phase II, so that there is at least one node to carry
information between the two phases. Write $Q_1 \frown Q_2$ to indicate that
every element of $Q_1$ intersects every member of $Q_2$: more formally $Q_1
\frown Q_2$ iff every $q_1 \in Q_1$ and $q_2 \in Q_2$ have ${q_1 \cap q_2 \ne
\varnothing}$.

In the original presentation of the Synod algorithm any (weighted) majority of
the nodes could be used as a quorum: roughly speaking, \[Q^\textrm{I}(p_1) =
Q^\textrm{II}(p_2) = \{ q \mid q \text{ is a majority}\}\] was a constant,
where $Q^\textrm{I}(p)$ and $Q^\textrm{II}(p)$ are the phase-I and phase-II
memberships at proposal $p$ respectively.  In this case $Q^\textrm{I}(p_1)
\frown Q^\textrm{II}(p_2)$ for all $p_1$ and $p_2$ since all majorities
intersect.  This intersection property is stronger than needed, and the ability
to vary the set of quorums by proposal and by phase is the key ingredient in
being able to perform jitter-free membership changes. The proof of theorem
\ref{synod-safety-theorem} in appendix \ref{synod-safety} is a generalisation
of the original one to demonstrate that consistency is preserved in the Synod
algorithm even under the weaker assumption that $Q^\textrm{I}(p_1) \frown
Q^\textrm{II}(p_2)$ only when $\chosen{}{p_2}$ and $p_1 \succ p_2$.

\section{The Paxos algorithm}

Conceptually, Paxos is a sequence of distinct instances of the Synod algorithm
all running simultaneously. To achieve this, the messages of the Synod
algorithm above are indexed with the instance number $i \in \mathbb N$:
$\fprom{i}{a}{p}$, $\bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'}$, $\prop{i}{p}$ and $\acc{i}{a}{p}$.
There is another kind of message known as a \textit{multi-promise}, written
$\mprom{i}{a}{p}$, which can be thought of as standing for the infinite set of
free promises ${\{ \fprom{j}{a}{p} \mid j \ge i \}}$. The predicate
$\chosen{i}{p}$ is also indexed by the instance number $i$, but in this
presentation prepare messages $\prep{p}$ apply to all instances so do not need
to be indexed.

Recall that in each Synod instance each node is a state machine whose
transitions are caused by the receipt of messages. In Paxos, let $S_i$ be the
state machine for instance $i$. Because at any time each node has only ever
received finitely many messages, there must be an instance number $i_\infty$
such that all instances $i \ge i_\infty$ are in the same state. A Paxos node
therefore needs to have a separate state machine $S_i$ for each instance $i <
i_\infty$ but then just a single state machine $S_\infty$ that represents all
instances $i \ge i_\infty$. When a message mentioning an instance $i \ge
i_\infty$ is received, the node must increase $i_\infty$ to $i'_\infty > i$ and
create (or \textit{spawn}) state machines $S_j$ for $i_\infty \le j <
i'_\infty$, all of which start in the same state as $S_\infty$. Typically, when
all the instances up to $i$ are chosen at a node then this node ignores any
further messages about these instances and discards the corresponding state
machines.

As in the Synod algorithm, phase I starts with a broadcast of $\prep{p}$ for
some $p$ to which each node $a$ may respond with a set of promises
$\fprom{i}{a}{p}$, $\bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'}$ and $\mprom{i}{a}{p}$ according to the
state of its state machines. If a node receives $\mprom{i}{a}{p}$ messages from
a quorum of nodes then its state machine $S_\infty$ has completed phase I at
$p$, and therefore any state machines that are subsequently spawned will also
have completed phase I at $p$. Each phase II instance $i$ operates just as in
the Synod algorithm, starting with a broadcast of $\prop{i}{p}$ to which each
node $a$ may respond with an acceptance $\acc{i}{a}{p}$ and once acceptances
have been received from a quorum of nodes it follows that $\chosen{i}{p}$ and
phase II is complete for instance $i$.

There is a function $v_i : \mathbb P \to \mathbb V$ for each instance $i$
giving a value to each proposal, and theorem \ref{paxos-safety-theorem} shows
that whenever $\chosen{i}{p}$ and $\chosen{i}{p'}$ it follows that $v_i(p) =
v_i(p')$.


\subsection{Membership changes}\label{membership-changes}

Changes in the cluster membership are handled with a sequence of numbered
\textit{epochs} $1, 2, \ldots$ and memberships $Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, \ldots$
satisfying $Q_{e-1} \frown Q_e$ and $Q_e \frown Q_e$ for all epochs $e$.  This
means $Q_{e-1}$ and $Q_e$ can be used for the phase-I and phase-II memberships
of a Paxos instance respectively by the observation of \ref{per-phase-quorums}
above, or alternatively $Q_e$ can be used for both phases.

There are also two nondecreasing functions, both written $e(\cdot)$, which
respectively assign an epoch number $e(i)$ to each instance $i$, and an epoch
number $e(p)$ to each proposal $p$. A node may emit $\prop{i}{p}$ if $e(p) \le
e(i)$ and it has received promises for proposal $p$ in instance $i$ from a
quorum $q^\textrm{I} \in Q_{e(p)}$. A node considers phase II to be complete at
instance $i$ and proposal $p$ if ${e(i) \le e(p)+1}$ and it has received
$\acc{i}{a}{p}$ from a quorum ${q^\textrm{II} \in Q_{e(i)}}$.  Thus if
$\chosen{i}{p}$ then ${e(p) \in \{ e(i)-1, e(i) \}}$ and hence \[q^\textrm{I}
\in Q_{e(p)} \frown Q_{e(i)} \ni q^\textrm{II}\] so that $q^\textrm{I} \cap
q^\textrm{II} \ne \varnothing$ as required. It is worth emphasising the subtle
point that phase I uses the membership $Q_{e(p)}$ corresponding to the proposal
$p$ whereas phase II uses the membership $Q_{e(i)}$ for the instance $i$, with
extra conditions to ensure that $e(p) \le e(i) \le e(p) + 1$ and therefore that
the epochs used in the two phases are close enough.

\subsection{Dynamic membership changes}

As in Dynamic Paxos, the memberships $Q_0, Q_1, \ldots$ and epoch numbers
$e(i)$ are themselves chosen by Paxos. In more detail, memberships are tracked
by a state machine whose state is the finite sequence $Q_0, \ldots,
Q_{e_\mathrm{max}}$ and the epoch numbers of instances are tracked by a state
machine whose state is the finite sequence $e(0), \ldots, e(i_\mathrm{max})$.
Their transitions append one or more elements to these sequences, but do not
change any existing elements, and the tracked sequences are always long enough
to make progress: if $\chosen{i}{p}$ then the epoch-number state machine
satisfies $i_\mathrm{max} > i+1$ and $e_\mathrm{max} \ge e(i_\mathrm{max})$ in
the membership-sequence state machine. Epoch numbers $e(p)$ for proposals $p$
are fixed in advance and not chosen by Paxos.

Note that in order to check whether phase I is complete for a proposal $p$ at
an instance $i$ a node must check whether it has received promises from a
quorum of nodes $q \in Q_{e(p)}$, for which it needs to know $Q_{e(p)}$. This
can be achieved by ensuring that nodes do not emit $\prep{p}$ messages for
proposals for which $Q_{e(p)}$ is not known. The node must also check that
$e(p) \le e(i)$; if $e(i)$ is not known then $i_\mathrm{max} < i$, but $e$ is a
nondecreasing function so $e(i_\mathrm{max}) \le e(i)$ and it is therefore
sufficient to check that $e(p) \le e(i_\mathrm{max})$.

Similarly, in order to check whether phase II is complete for a proposal $p$ at
an instance $i$ a node must check whether it has received acceptances from a
quorum of nodes $q \in Q_{e(i)}$ and must therefore know the value of
$Q_{e(i)}$. This will be known if the node has chosen the previous instance,
because if $\chosen{i-1}{p'}$ then $i < i_\mathrm{max}$ and hence ${e(i) \le
e(i_\mathrm{max}) \le e_\mathrm{max}}$ as required.

\subsection{Jitter-free membership changes}

To see that in normal operation this allows for a membership change without
jitter, let $i_0$ be a fixed instance and $p$ a proposal with $e(i_0) = e(p)$,
and suppose that the node $\owner{p}$ has received a quorum of promises
$q^\textrm{I} \in Q_{e(p)}$ for proposal $p$ for all instances $i \ge i_0$.


TODO do this the same, but better

To see that this allows for membership changes without requiring a new phase I
to run, let $i_0$ be a fixed instance and suppose that the node $\owner{p}$ has
received a quorum of promises $q^\textrm{I} \in Q_{e(p)}$ for proposal $p$ for
all instances $i \ge i_0$ and suppose that $e(i_0) = e(p)$. The node can
therefore send $\prop{i}{p}$ for any $i \ge i_0$ and will consider phase II to
be complete at instance $i$ when it receives acceptances from a quorum
$q^\textrm{II} \in Q_{e(i)}$ as long as $e(i) \le e(p) + 1$. Thus it can
complete phase II for all instances in the same epoch as $i_0$ and also for all
instances in the next epoch too.  However it cannot complete phase II for any
further epochs, so once it has entered the epoch $e(i_0) + 1$ it should prepare
for the next membership change by running a new phase I for a new proposal $p'$
having $e(p') = e(i_0) + 1$. Importantly, at this point this new phase I is not
on the critical path of the phase II of any future instances as long as no
further membership change is yet proposed, so cannot cause jitter if it is
delayed. Once the new phase I is complete, another membership change may be
performed in the same way. Typically, as with Cheap Paxos\cite{cheap-paxos}
this new phase I is run on a subset of all the nodes while the remaining nodes
continue to run phase II on proposal $p$.

\subsection{Examples}\label{types-of-membership-change}

\def\maj#1{\mathbf{maj}(#1)}

Implementations can ensure $Q_e \frown Q_e$ for each $e$ by, for instance,
arranging for each quorum in $Q_e$ to comprise a (weighted) majority subset of
some finite set of nodes.  If $Q_{e-1}$ and $Q_e$ are nonempty then intuitively
the condition that $Q_{e-1} \frown Q_e$ ensures that the membership change from
$Q_{e-1}$ to $Q_e$ is sufficiently small that phase I need not re-run when
moving from epoch $e-1$ to epoch $e$.  For instance, if $Q_{e-1} \frown
Q_{e-1}$ then the trivial membership change, having $Q_e = Q_{e-1}$, certainly
satisfies $Q_{e-1} \frown Q_e \frown Q_e$.

For a less trivial example, let \[\maj{s} = \{ q \subseteq s \mid 2 |q| > |s|
\}\] be the set of all majority subsets of a finite set $s \subseteq \mathbb
A$, and note that $\maj{s} \frown \maj{s}$ for all such $s$.  If $\mathbb A =
\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots \}$ then let $s_n = \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$ and observe that
${\maj{s_3} \frown \maj{s_4}}$ and ${\maj{s_4} \frown \maj{s_5}}$ but ${\maj{s_3}
\not\frown \maj{s_5}}$ because $\{a_1, a_2\} \in \maj{s_3}$ and $\{a_3, a_4,
a_5\} \in \maj{s_5}$ do not intersect. Thus the majority subsets of $s_3$ and
$s_4$ are sufficiently similar to be consecutive memberships, but those of
$s_3$ and $s_5$ are not.

The intuition that $Q_{e-1} \frown Q_e$ captures that $Q_{e-1}$ and $Q_e$ are
similar breaks down if either is empty because $\varnothing \frown Q$ vacuously
for all memberships $Q$. Clearly if there is an instance $j$ such that
$Q_{e(j)} = \varnothing$ then no value can ever be chosen for $j$, but an epoch
may be skipped at instance $i$ by letting $e(i) = e(i-1) + 2$.  This recovers
the ability to perform arbitrary membership changes in a single step as in
Dynamic Paxos: if the system is currently using membership $Q_{e(i)}$ and an
operator wishes to change to an unrelated membership $Q'$ (where necessarily
$Q' \frown Q'$) then they can set $Q_{e(i)+1} = \varnothing$ and $Q_{e(i)+2} =
Q'$, which satisfies that \[Q_{e(i)} \frown Q_{e(i) + 1} \frown Q_{e(i)+1}
\frown Q_{e(i) + 2} \frown Q_{e(i) + 2}\] as desired. However, re-running phase
I can only be avoided if the epoch increases by $1$ and in this situation the
epoch increases by $2$, so the new phase I must be complete before any new
phase II instances can be started which reintroduces the risk of jitter.  As in
Dynamic Paxos, to mitigate this risk the operator chooses an $\alpha > 0$ and
sets $e(i+\alpha) = e(i)+2$ and $e(j) = e(i)$ for $i < j \le i + \alpha$,
effectively delaying the membership change for $\alpha$ instances, in the hope
that this is long enough to have completed the new phase I.

\subsection{Weight-based memberships}
\label{weight-based-memberships}

Let a \textit{weight} function be a function $w : \mathbb A \to \mathbb N$ that
only takes finitely many nonzero values. This can be used to define a
membership $M(w)$ by \textit{majority}: \[M(w) = \left\{ q \;\middle|\; \sum_{a
\in q} 2 w(a) > \sum_{a \in \mathbb A} w(a) \right\}.\] If $w(a) = 0$ for all
$a$ then $w$ is said to be \textit{weightless} and $M(w) = \varnothing$.
Corollary \ref{weights-equal} shows that $M(w) \frown M(w)$ for any weight
function $w$.

A sequence $w_0, w_1, \ldots$ of weight functions can be used to define the
sequence of memberships $M(w_0), M(w_1), \ldots$ used by a cluster, which must
satisfy $M(w_{e-1}) \frown M(w_e)$ for all $e$.  There are three simple ways to
ensure this:

\begin{enumerate}

\item If $w_{e-1}$ and $w_e$ differ by a constant factor, in the sense that
there are positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $m w_{e-1}(a) = n w_e(a)$ for
all $a$, then clearly ${M(w_{e-1}) = M(w_e)}$ and hence the property holds.

\item By theorem \ref{weights-nearly-equal} if $w_{e-1}$ and $w_e$ are equal
except perhaps at a single node at which they differ by $1$ then the property
holds.

\item Finally, if $w_{e-1}$ is weightless then the property holds vacuously.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Paxos supports both the crash-stop and crash-recover failure modes.

To do crash-recovery, there must be a write to stable storage between
receiving a $\prop{i}{p}$ message and replying with $\acc{i}{a}{p}$.

Raises the question of what to do if storage itself is lost? What does
``stable'' mean?

In a realistic system, all nodes will eventually fail unrecoverably.





\subsection{TODO merge with the above}

Typically the nodes in a system must be taken offline for maintenance from time
to time. Since Paxos is designed to be resilient to failures of nodes, a simple
approach is to treat offline nodes just as if they have failed. By taking each
node offline in turn, the system can remain available even while maintenance is
being performed.

However, a na\"ive approach to this puts the system at risk during the upgrade:
in a cluster of three equally-weighted nodes if one of the nodes is taken
offline then the failure of another node would render the system unavailable.
More generally, if the system is to be resilient to $\le f$ failures then a
node $a_{\textrm{maint}}$ may be safely taken offline if all other nodes have
weight $< \sum_{a \in \mathbb A} \frac{w(a)}{2f} - w(a_{\textrm{maint}})$. For
example, if $f = 1$ and all nodes have equal weights then the smallest cluster
in which a node may be safely taken offline for maintenance has five nodes.
Assuming that the cost of operating a cluster is proportional to the number of
nodes, this represents a significant overhead simply to cover relatively rare
periods of maintenance: if maintenance is ignored then only three nodes are
required.

The required number of nodes can be reduced using a membership change as
follows. A cluster of four equally-weighted nodes can only tolerate a single
failure, but by reducing the weight of node $a_{\textrm{maint}}$ to zero before
taking it offline, the remaining three nodes can tolerate the loss of another
node. The sequence of weights used for this procedure is as follows, with
maintenance on $a_{\textrm{maint}}$ occurring during while $w_{e+1}$ is in use.
\[\begin{array}{rcccc}
\textrm{node}&a_{\textrm{maint}}&a_1&a_2&a_3 \\
w_e&1&1&1&1\\
w_{e+1}&0&1&1&1\\
w_{e+2}&1&1&1&1\\
\end{array}\]
Since each step changes the weight of a single node by $1$ this sequence
satisfies $M(w_e) \frown M(w_{e+1}) \frown M(w_{e+2})$ and hence can be
performed without jitter.

In many situations it is feasible simply to replace a node $a_{\textrm{old}}$
with a new node $a_{\textrm{new}}$ rather than to upgrade it in-situ. If
$a_{\textrm{new}}$ is brought online before $a_{\textrm{old}}$ is taken offline
then the system is not put at risk, requiring four nodes to perform maintenance
but only three in normal operation:
\[\begin{array}{rcccc}
\textrm{node}&a_{\textrm{old}}&a_{\textrm{new}}&a_1&a_2 \\
w_e&1&0&1&1\\
w_{e+1}&1&1&1&1\\
w_{e+2}&0&1&1&1\\
\end{array}\]
Again, each step changes the weight of a single node by $1$ so this sequence
satisfies $M(w_e) \frown M(w_{e+1}) \frown M(w_{e+2})$.

Assuming that node failures are independent, the probability of a cluster-wide
failure can appear to be extremely small. However, in a real-world system node
failures are not always independent: certain sets of nodes may share critical
infrastructure such as power or network connectivity, and a failure of this
infrastructure would cause a simultaneous failure of all the dependent nodes.
To control this sitation, the cluster may be divided into \textit{zones}, where
the nodes within a single zone may share infrastructure but failures in
different zones can be considered to be independent. In a traditional data
centre environment, individual racks are often assumed to be independent, so
each rack could be a separate zone. If geographical redundancy is required then
the cluster will be separated across multiple data centres, each of which is an
independent zone, and many cloud environments also divide their services into
zones in this way.  For the system to be resilient to simultaneous zone-wide
failures of $f_z > 0$ zones, it must have nodes running in at least $2f_z + 1
\ge 3$ zones.

The four-node maintenance process described above is only safe if each node is
in a different zone: if any two of them are in the same zone then system will
fail if there is a zone-wide failure in epoch $w_{e+1}$.  In many operating
environments it may be expensive or complicated to arrange for four independent
zones\footnote{For instance, at time of writing, only one Amazon Web Services
region (\texttt{us-east-1}) has four independent zones, whereas four of them
have three: \texttt{ap-southeast-2}, \texttt{eu-west-1}, \texttt{sa-east-1} and
\texttt{us-west-2}. Similarly, only one Google Cloud Platform region
(\texttt{us-central1}) has four zones and all the others have three zones.},
particularly if the fourth zone is only required to ensure consistency in
relatively rare periods of maintenance.  Fortunately, it is possible to safely
replace a node within a single zone $z_{\textrm{maint}}$ using four nodes but
only three zones with the following sequence of operations.
\[\begin{array}{rcccc}
\textrm{zone}&z_{\textrm{maint}}&z_{\textrm{maint}}&z_1&z_2\\
\textrm{node}&a_{\textrm{old}}&a_{\textrm{new}}&a_1&a_2\\
w_e&1&0&1&1\\
w_{e+1}&2&0&2&2\\
w_{e+2}&1&0&2&2\\
w_{e+3}&1&1&2&2\\
w_{e+4}&0&1&2&2\\
w_{e+5}&0&2&2&2\\
w_{e+6}&0&1&1&1\\
\end{array}\]
At every stage it is clear that every zone contains less than half of the total
weight, so the system is never at risk of a single-zone failure. Note that the
first and last steps rely on the ability to simultaneously change the weights
of every node by a constant factor, and every other step changes the weight of
a single node by one, so this satisfies $M(w_{e+k}) \frown M(w_{e+k+1})$ for $0
\le k \le 6$ and hence can be performed without jitter.

\section{Preserving the Paxos invariants}

If no messages have been sent then the invariants shown above certainly hold,
so as long as each message that each node sends preserves the invariants then
consistency is maintained.

Any node may emit $\prep{p}$.

The interplay between promises and acceptances is reasonably straightforward:
the node $a$ may emit promises $\fprom{i}{a}{p}$ etc. and acceptances
$\acc{i}{a}{p}$ where they do not conflict with previously-sent messages. In
more detail, it may emit $\mprom{i}{a}{p}$ if it has previously sent no
$\acc{i'}{a}{p'}$ for any $p'$ and any $i' \le i$.  It may emit
$\fprom{i}{a}{p}$ if it has previously sent no $\acc{i}{a}{p'}$ for any $p'$.
It may emit $\bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'}$ if $p' \prec p$, $\acc{i}{a}{p'}$ and $p'$ is
the greatest such proposal. It may emit $\acc{i}{a}{p}$ as long as
$\prop{i}{p}$ and it does not violate any previously-made promises, in the
sense that whenever \begin{itemize} \item $\mprom{i'}{a}{p'}$ for any $i' \le
i$, or \item $\fprom{i}{a}{p'}$, or \item $\bprom{i}{a}{p'}{p''}$\end{itemize}
it is the case that $p' \preceq p$.

TODO expand this next bit, it's very complicated!

The node $\owner{p}$ may change the value $v_i(p)$ as long as it has not
already emitted $\prop{p}{i}$, and may consider phase I to be complete for
proposal $p$ at instance $i$, and may therefore emit $\prop{p}{i}$, if there is an
earlier instance ${i' < i}$ and proposal $p'$ such that $\chosen{i'}{p'}$ and
$e(p) \le e(i')$ (or else $i = 0$), and there is a quorum $q \in Q_{e(p)}$ such
that for every $a \in q$ it has previously received a promise from node $a$ for
proposal $p$ in instance $i$. If it has not already emitted $\prop{p}{i}$ and
any of the promises from nodes in $q$ are of the form $\bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'}$
then it must first set \[v_i(p) = v_i\bigl(\mathrm{max} \{p' \mid
\bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'} \textrm{ received}, a \in q \}\bigr).\]

Finally any node may consider phase II to be complete for proposal $p$ at instance
$i$, and therefore $\chosen{p}{i}$, if
\begin{itemize}
\item $e(i) \le e(p) + 1$,
\item if $i > 0$ then $\chosen{i-1}{p'}$ for some $p'$, and
\item there is a quorum $q \in
Q_{e(i)}$ such that $\acc{i}{a}{p}$ has been received from every $a \in q$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Consistency of the Synod algorithm}
\label{synod-safety}

The consistency property of the Synod algorithm is derived from the following
invariants.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \label{synod-quorums} For proposal identifiers $p_1 \succ p_2 \in \mathbb
P$ there are memberships $Q^\textrm{I}(p_1)$ and $Q^\textrm{II}(p_2) \subseteq
\mathcal P \mathbb A$ such that if $\chosen{}{p_2}$ then ${Q^\textrm{I}(p_1)
\frown Q^\textrm{II}(p_2)}$.

\item \label{synod-fprom} $\fprom{}{a}{p}$ only if $\neg\acc{}{a}{p'}$ for all
${p' \prec p}$.

\item \label{synod-bprom} $\bprom{}{a}{p}{p'}$ only if $p' \prec p$,
$\acc{}{a}{p'}$, and $p'$ is the greatest such proposal, in the sense that
$\neg\acc{}{a}{p''}$ for all $p''$ having $p' \prec p'' \prec p$.

\item \label{synod-prop} $\prop{}{p}$ only if there is a quorum $q^\textrm{I}
\in Q^\textrm{I}(p)$ such that for every $a \in q^\textrm{I}$ either
$\fprom{}{a}{p}$ or $\exists p'.  \bprom{}{a}{p}{p'}$, and if $P = \{ p' \mid
\exists a \in q^\textrm{I}. \bprom{}{a}{p}{p'} \} \ne \varnothing$ then $v(p) =
v(\mathrm{max}(P))$.

\item \label{synod-acc} $\acc{}{a}{p}$ only if $\prop{}{p}$.

\item \label{synod-chosen} $\chosen{}{p}$ only if there is a quorum
$q^\textrm{II} \in Q^\textrm{II}(p)$ such that $\acc{}{a}{p}$ for every $a \in
q^\textrm{II}$.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma}\label{synod-acc-bprom}If $\acc{}{a}{p_2}$, $\bprom{}{a}{p_1}{p_3}$
and $p_2 \prec p_1$ then $p_2 \preceq p_3$.\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}Since $\bprom{}{a}{p_1}{p_3}$ from invariant \ref{synod-bprom} it
follows that $p_3$ is the largest proposal such that $p_3 \prec p_1$ and
$\acc{}{a}{p_3}$, but $p_2$ is also such a proposal and therefore $p_2
\preceq p_3$ as required.  \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{synod-lemma} If $\chosen{}{p_2}$, $\prop{}{p_1}$ and $p_2
\prec p_1$ then $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$. \end{lemma}

\begin{proof}Suppose for a contradiction the result is false, and since $\prec$
is wellfounded suppose without loss of generality that $p_1$ is the minimal
proposal at which it is false.  Since $\chosen{}{p_2}$, by invariant
\ref{synod-chosen} there is a quorum $q^\textrm{II} \in Q^\textrm{II}(p_2)$
such that $\acc{}{a}{p_2}$ for every $a \in q^\textrm{II}$.  By invariant
\ref{synod-fprom} it cannot be that $\fprom{}{a}{p_1}$ for any $a \in
q^\textrm{II}$.  Also, since $\prop{}{p_1}$, by invariant \ref{synod-prop}
there is a quorum $q^\textrm{I} \in Q^\textrm{I}(p_1)$ such that either
$\fprom{}{a}{p_1}$ or $\exists p'.  \bprom{}{a}{p_1}{p'}$ for all $a \in
q^\textrm{I}$.  Let $P = \{ p' \mid \exists a \in q^\textrm{I}.
\bprom{}{a}{p_1}{p'} \}$.  By invariant \ref{synod-quorums},
${Q^\textrm{I}(p_1) \frown Q^\textrm{II}(p_2)}$ and hence $q^\textrm{I} \cap
q^\textrm{II} \ne \varnothing$ so it follows that $P \ne \varnothing$, which
means that $v(p_1) = v(\mathrm{max}(P))$ by invariant \ref{synod-prop}. Let
$a_{\mathrm{max}} \in q^\textrm{I}$ be such that
$\bprom{}{a_{\mathrm{max}}}{p_1}{\mathrm{max}(P)}$.  By invariant
\ref{synod-bprom} it follows that $\mathrm{max}(P) \prec p_1$ and also that
$\acc{}{a_{\mathrm{max}}}{\mathrm{max}(P)}$ and hence
$\prop{}{\mathrm{max}(P)}$ by invariant \ref{synod-acc}. Furthermore by lemma
\ref{synod-acc-bprom} it follows that $p_2 \preceq \mathrm{max}(P)$ and since
$p_1$ was assumed to be the smallest counterexample it must be that
$v(\mathrm{max}(P)) = v(p_2)$.  Hence $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$ which is a
contradiction as required.  \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{synod-safety-theorem} If $\chosen{}{p_1}$ and
$\chosen{}{p_2}$ then $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$.  \end{theorem}

\begin{proof} Without loss of generality assume that ${p_2 \prec p_1}$. By
invariant \ref{synod-chosen} there is a quorum $q \in Q^\textrm{II}(p_1)$ such
that $\acc{}{a}{p_1}$ for every node $a \in q$. Since $q$ is nonempty, by
invariant \ref{synod-acc} it must be that $\prop{}{p_1}$ was previously sent.
Therefore by lemma \ref{synod-lemma} it follows that $v(p_1) = v(p_2)$ as
required.  \end{proof}


\section{Consistency of the Paxos algorithm}

The consistency property of the Paxos algorithm is derived from the following
invariants.

\begin{enumerate}

\item\label{paxos-quorums} There is a sequence of memberships $Q_0, Q_1,
\ldots$ where ${Q_e \frown Q_e \frown Q_{e+1}}$ for all $e$.

\item\label{paxos-mprom} $\mprom{i}{a}{p}$ only if $\neg\acc{i'}{a}{p'}$ for all
$i' \ge i$ and $p' \prec p$.

\item\label{paxos-fprom} $\fprom{i}{a}{p}$ only if $\neg\acc{i}{a}{p'}$ for all
$p' \prec p$.

\item\label{paxos-bprom} $\bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'}$ only if \begin{itemize} \item
$p' \prec p$ \item $\acc{i}{a}{p'}$, and \item $p'$ is the greatest such
proposal, in the sense that $\neg \acc{i}{a}{p''}$ for all $p''$ having $p'
\prec p'' \prec p$. \end{itemize}

\item\label{paxos-prop} $\prop{i}{p}$ only if $e(p) \le e(i)$ and there is a
quorum $q \in Q_{e(p)}$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item for every $a \in q$ one of the following holds:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mprom{i'}{a}{p}$ for some $i' \le i$, or
\item $\fprom{i}{a}{p}$, or
\item $\bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'}$ for some $p'$, and
\end{itemize}

\item if $P = \{ p' \mid \exists a \in q. \bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'} \}
\ne \varnothing$ then $v_i(p) = v_i(\mathrm{max}(P))$.
\end{itemize}

\item \label{paxos-acc} $\acc{i}{a}{p}$ only if $\prop{i}{p}$.

\item \label{paxos-chosen} $\chosen{i}{p}$ only if
\begin{itemize}
\item $e(i) \le e(p) + 1$,
\item if $i > 0$ then $\chosen{i-1}{p'}$ for some $p'$, and
\item there is a quorum $q \in
Q_{e(i)}$ such that $\acc{i}{a}{p}$ for every $a \in q$.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{lemma}\label{paxos-synod-quorum-invariant} For proposal identifiers $p_1
\succ p_2 \in \mathbb P$ and instance $i$, if $\chosen{i}{p_2}$ and $e(p_1) \le
e(i)$ then ${Q_{e(p_1)} \frown Q_{e(i)}}$.  \end{lemma}

\begin{proof} Since $\chosen{i}{p_2}$ it follows that $e(i) \le e(p_2) + 1$,
and since $e$ is nondecreasing $e(p_2) \le e(p_1)$. Therefore $e(p_1) \in \{
e(i) - 1, e(i) \}$ and hence ${Q_{e(p_1)} \frown Q_{e(i)}}$ by invariant
\ref{paxos-quorums}.  \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{paxos-safety-theorem} If $\chosen{i}{p_1}$ and
$\chosen{i}{p_2}$ then ${v_i(p_1) = v_i(p_2)}$.  \end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If $\chosen{i}{p_1}$ then the Paxos invariants imply the Synod invariants for
instance $i$.  In more detail, let
\[\begin{array}{rl}
Q^\textrm{I}(p) &= \begin{cases}
Q_{e(p)} & e(p) \le e(i) \\
\varnothing & \textrm{otherwise,} \end{cases} \\
Q^\textrm{II}(p) &= Q_{e(i)}, \\
\fprom{}{a}{p} &= \fprom{i}{a}{p} \\
& \ {}\vee \exists i' \le i. \mprom{i'}{a}{p}, \\
\bprom{}{a}{p}{p'} &= \bprom{i}{a}{p}{p'}, \\
\prop{}{p} &= \prop{i}{p}, \\
\acc{}{a}{p} &= \acc{i}{a}{p} \textrm{ and} \\
\chosen{}{p} &= \chosen{i}{p}. \\
v(p) &= v_i(p)\\
\end{array}
\]
Synod's invariant \ref{synod-quorums} follows from lemma
\ref{paxos-synod-quorum-invariant} and the fact that $\varnothing \frown
Q_{e(i)}$ and the remaining invariants are simple to show so by theorem
\ref{synod-safety-theorem} it follows that $v_i(p_1) = v_i(p_2)$ as required.
\end{proof}


\section{Consecutive epochs using weight-based membership}

\begin{theorem} \label{weights-nearly-equal} Let $w, w' : \mathbb A \to \mathbb
N$ be weight functions and let $a_0 \in \mathbb A$ be such that $|w(a_0) -
w'(a_0)| \le 1$ and $w(a) = w'(a)$ for all $a \ne a_0$. Then $M(w) \frown
M(w')$.  \end{theorem}

\begin{proof} Let $q \in M(w)$ and $q' \in M(w')$. By the
  definition of $M$, and since $w$ and $w'$ take only integer values,
%
$\sum_{a \in q} 2 w(a) \ge \sum_{a \in \mathbb A} w(a) + 1$
%
and
%
$\sum_{a \in q'} 2 w'(a) \ge \sum_{a \in \mathbb A} w'(a) + 1$.
%
Let $d_{\mathbb A} = w'(a_0) - w(a_0)$ so that $\sum_{a \in \mathbb A} w'(a) =
\sum_{a \in \mathbb A} w(a) + d_{\mathbb A}$ and $|d_\mathbb A| \le 1$. Also
let \[ d_{q'} =
\begin{cases}
%
d_{\mathbb A} & a_0 \in q' \\
%
0 & \textrm{otherwise,}
%
\end{cases}
\]
so that $\sum_{a \in q'} w'(a) = \sum_{a \in q'} w(a) + d_{q'}$.
%
Then
\begin{gather*}
%
\sum_{a \in \mathbb A} 2w(a) + d_{\mathbb A} + 2 \\
%
\begin{aligned}
%
&= \left( \sum_{a \in \mathbb A} w(a)  + 1\right)
+  \left( \sum_{a \in \mathbb A} w'(a) + 1\right) \\
%
&\le \sum_{a \in q}  2w(a)
+    \sum_{a \in q'} 2w'(a) \\
%
&= \sum_{a \in q}  2w(a)
+  \sum_{a \in q'} 2w(a) + 2d_{q'}\\
%
&= \sum_{a \in q \cup q'} 2w(a)
+  \sum_{a \in q \cap q'} 2w(a) + 2d_{q'}\\
%
&\le \sum_{a \in \mathbb A} 2w(a)
+    \sum_{a \in q \cap q'} 2w(a) + 2d_{q'},\\
%
\end{aligned}\end{gather*} so that $\sum_{a \in q \cap q'} 2w(a) \ge d_{\mathbb
A} + 2 - 2d_{q'} = 2 \pm d_\mathbb A \ge 1$ and hence $q \cap q' \ne \varnothing$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary} \label{weights-equal} If $w : \mathbb A \to \mathbb N$ is a
weight function then \[M(w) \frown M(w).\]  \end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
This is a special case of theorem \ref{weights-nearly-equal}, where $w' = w$.
\end{proof}
